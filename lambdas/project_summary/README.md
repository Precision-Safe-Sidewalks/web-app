When updating the project summary template, the following actions must be completed:
- Clear cells P22+ through AF22+ on the work date sheets (something is corrupt here)
- Update the `TEMPLATE` constant in `project_summary.go`
- Update the `SUMMARY_CURBS_TABLE_MAX_ROW` constant in `project_summary.go`
- Update the `SUMMARY_SIDEWALKS_TABLE_MAX_ROW` constant in `project_summary.go`
